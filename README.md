# CheckIn Tracker

#### Problem
During the COVID-19 pandemic businesses were required to keep track of the how many people were in the businesses space, contact details of customers and other specific compliance issues. 

The Australian government and industry bodies required businsses to have a *'contract tracing register'*, which may be requested by public health officials if needed. It contained the following information:
- date;
- sign in time;
- sign out time;
- name;
- email address;
- residential address;
- contact number; and 
- comments. 
(Link to example contract tracing register: https://www.covid19.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0034/129967/industry-covid-safe-plan-retail-food-services.pdf)

The register was placed on a table at the front of the restaurant with no methods to protect previous customers information from being copied or misused by other members of the public. 

#### Why does the problem need solving?
CheckIn Tracker ensures that customer information is secured, not susceptible to misuse by other customers and an online solution reducing the need for paper.

CheckIn Tracker provides an online solution and if needed, makes it easy to send the data to the public health officials. This means that restaurants can be compliant with Government requirements.
